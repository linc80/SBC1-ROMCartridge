# SBC1-ROMCartridge
Contains the L80RomCartridge and L80RomCart-Adapter, needed to use the ROMSLOT header on a LiNC80 SBC1

The current version references libraries not included in the repository. There is a current TODO to change this over to using library files in the working project path, and verify compatibility with KiCad 5.
